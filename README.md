## üöÄ How to Use
- Using these buttons in your project is incredibly simple:

- Clone or Download:

```
git clone https://github.com/khdxsohee/Modern-Button-Kit.git
```
- Or download the ZIP file directly from the GitHub repository.

## Include the CSS:
- Copy the style.css (or the relevant <style> block content if you're using it directly) from this repository into your project. You can either:

- Directly copy the <style> block into the <head> section of your HTML file.
- Create a style.css file in your project and paste all the CSS into it, then link it in your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/style.css">
```
- Add the HTML:
- Browse through the modern-button-kit.html file (or your copied buttons.html file) in this repository. Find the button you want, copy its <button> tag, and paste it into your HTML where you want the button to appear.

### Example:

```
<button class="download-button button-primary">Download</button>
```
(Remember that the download-button class sets up basic styling, and additional classes like button-primary apply the unique styles.)
